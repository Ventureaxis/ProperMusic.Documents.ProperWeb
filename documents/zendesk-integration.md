# Zendesk Integration

ProperWeb includes a Zendesk support desk integration which allows users to request help from the Proper Music Team.

## Support Button
To access Zendesk Support, there is a support button at the bottom right of every page. Clicking this button will open the Zendesk Support widget and allow the user to start the process of submitting support requests.
